# Integer Sequences CPP

This C++ project contains builds for both x86 and x64 architectures,
which includes run-time and compile-time constructs for generating common integer sequences.
Developed by Tyler R. Drury, with Visual Studios 2017.

## Builds

1. uses conventional class based Object Oriented Programming Techniques
2. uses template meta programming to leverage recursion to create a static deck
3. uses bitwise operations to reduce overall size of of a deck, while increasing speed of operations
